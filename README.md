## Archive of truetandem/e-QIP-prototype

This repository is an archive of the software development activities of [TrueTandem](http://www.truetandem.com) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) for the [Agile BPA Task Order for Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Prototype Development](https://github.com/18F/bpa-opm-eqip) (RFQ1138886). This task order ran from November 3, 2016 through May 2, 2018.

The authoritative repository for the e-QIP prototype is located at [18F/e-QIP-prototype](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype).

While TrueTandem was on contract, day-to-day development occurred in this repository fork, originally located at [truetandem/e-QIP-prototype](https://github.com/truetandem/e-QIP-prototype). At regular intervals 18F personnel would merge source code from it into the authoritative, upstream [18F repo](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype).

As the TrueTandem repository was used to manage project issues, the repo has been archived here, under 18F control<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, to ensure that the generated URLs for the issue mentions in commit messages continue to function in the authoritative repository. All open issues were copied to [18F/e-QIP-prototype](https://github.com/18F/e-QIP-prototype). 

<sup><a name="myfootnote1">1</a></sup>GitHub does not permit a fork of a repository to be transferred to an organization (e.g., [18F](https://github.com/18F)) if the original upstream repository resides there.
